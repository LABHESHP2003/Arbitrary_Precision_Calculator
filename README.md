# Arbitrary_Precision_Calculator
Project Brief: A calculator in C that supports arithmetic operations on arbitrarily large numbers using big‑number (multiple precision) arithmetic. APC stores numbers in a data structure (linked list as an Abstract Data Type) to allow for operations beyond built‑in fixed widths.
